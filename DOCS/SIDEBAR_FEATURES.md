## Troubleshooting

### "No data provider registered" Error

This error indicates the sidebar view provider isn't properly registered. This has been fixed in the latest version by:

- Ensuring proper view ID matching between package.json and extension registration
- Adding proper error handling for webview initialization
- Including connection history functionality

### Connection Issues

- Verify your device has wireless debugging enabled
- Check that both device and computer are on the same network
- Ensure the IP address and port are correct
- Try connecting via USB first to establish trust

### History Not Saving

- History is stored in VSCode's global state
- If history isn't persisting, check VSCode permissions
- Clear history and try adding a new connection

## Technical Details

### Data Provider Registration

The sidebar is registered as a webview view provider with the ID `droidbridge-sidebar` in the `droidbridge` view container.

### State Management

- Connection status is synchronized between the extension and webview
- History is managed by the ConnectionHistoryManager class
- Real-time updates via message passing between webview and extension

### Security

- Content Security Policy (CSP) restricts script execution
- Nonce-based script loading for security
- Input validation on both client and server sides
